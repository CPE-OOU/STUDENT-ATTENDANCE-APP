## Introduction
 This project aims to develop and deploy a facial recognition system for automatic student attendance marking in classrooms or other environments. The system seeks to overcome the inefficiencies and inaccuracies of traditional methods, offering a faster, more reliable, and secure solution. However, it must carefully consider and address concerns around privacy, bias, and cost to ensure ethical and effective implementation.

## Installation

Before you start, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. To check whether Node.js is installed you have to run this command `node --version`.If you got a response that looks something like
this `v[number].[number].[number]` like on my system, I had the `v21.0.1` installed. Node.js version starting from `v18` will work just fine with the project.

Once you have Node.js and MongoDB installed, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/CPE-OOU/STUDENT-ATTENDANCE-APP.git`.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Open the project in any IDE of your choose, Bring up your integrated terminal or you can also use your standalone terminal app but ensure you are properly navigated to the project directory. Then run this command `npm install` and wait for the process to complete

3. **Set Up Our Environmental variable**: Ensure that the environmental variables are properly set up, As these contains project secret with are not to be expose to the general public.

4. **Run the Project**: Finally, run `npm start` to start the project in a development mode.

## Usage

After you've completed the installation process, you're ready to start using the application.
